Provide default value  
In the Select box choose Content ID From URL   
#### WHEN THE FILTER VALUE IS AVAILABLE OR A DEFAULT IS PROVIDED
Specify validation criteria  
Validator select box: Content  
Content Types: choose the content types you want the view to work with.  
Filter Value Format: Node ID  
Action to take if the filter value does not validate: Hide View.   
7 - Click apply  
8 - Add desired fields from User: & save the View  
9 - Go to Structure -> Block layout and configure the block to show on the types of content (node type) you want it to show on.
